/**
   \file SU2HamiltonianNoLinks.h Definition of the class that implements a truncated SU2 Hamiltonian following the reduced gauge invariant basis presented in the paper "Hamer, C. SU(2) Yang-Mills theory in (1 + 1) dimensions: A finite-lattice approach Nuclear Physics B , 1982, 195, 503 - 521". Contrary to the version in ReducedSU2Hamiltonian.h, this one does not explicitly contain the gauge links, but instead the fermionic sites have one degree of freedom added to encode the gauge field.

   we encode the four possible cases by \f$ |0\rangle, |1\rangle, |2\rangle, |3\rangle \f$, where \f$ |0\rangle \f$ (\f$|3\rangle \f$) means that the site is occupied by no fermion (two fermions), and \f$ |1\rangle \f$ (\f$|2\rangle \f$) mean that the site is occupied by a single fermion and the field to the right is going down (up) by one quanta. Thus, by knowing \f$ l_0 \f$ one can reconstruct the field values form the fermionic configuration. For all the implementation here \f$ l_0=0 \f$ is used.
   
   The bond dimension of the Hamiltonian MPO is hence growing with the dimension of the links \f$ d_\mathrm{link}\f$ and is given by \f$ D=17+d_\mathrm{link} \f$.
