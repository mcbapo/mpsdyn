/**
   \file SU2HamiltonianNoLinksDimlessQ.h  Definition of the class that implements a truncated SU2 Hamiltonian following the reduced gauge invariant basis presented in the paper "Hamer, C. SU(2) Yang-Mills theory in (1 + 1) dimensions: A finite-lattice approach Nuclear Physics B , 1982, 195, 503 - 521". Contrary to the version in ReducedSU2Hamiltonian.h, this one does not explicitly contain the gauge links, but instead the fermionic sites have one degree of freedom added to encode the gauge field. This version additionally penalizes states that do not have a total abelian charge of zero. This version is furthermore dimensionless such that it is suitable for calculations which should be extrapolated to the continuum
