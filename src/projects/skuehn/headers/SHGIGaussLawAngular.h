    Implementation of the Schwinger Hamiltonian in the spin representation with simplified link fields that violate the gauge invariance of the Hamiltonian. This version employs \f$ L(n) = a_n^\dagger a_n \f$ and chooses \f$ \theta(n) \f$ accordingly so that in the continuum the commutator fulfills  \f$ [\theta(n),L(m)]=i\delta_{n,m} \f$
