  /** Creates an instance of cQED from arXiv: 1303.5050 in 1+1d. The Hamiltonian is given by 
   \f[ H = M\sum_n (-1)^n\psi_n^\dagger\psi_n + \frac{\varepsilon}{\sqrt{l(l+1)}}\sum_n \left(\psi_n^\dagger L_{+,n}\psi_{n+1}+h.c.\right)+\frac{g^2}{8}\sum_n L_{z,n}^2\f]
   where 
   \f[L_+ = a^\dagger b,\quad L_- = b^\dagger a,\quad L_z = \frac{1}{2}(N_a - N_b),\quad l=\frac{1}{2}(N_a+N_b) = \frac{N_0}{2}.  \f]    
   and \f$ a\f$ and \f$ b \f$ are the annihilation operators for two different bosonic species. The total number of bosons per link, \f$ N_{0} \f$, is fixed to an even value. After a Jordan Wigner transformation and rendering the result dimensionless we obtain the spin Hamiltonian which is implemented in this class. The formula is the following:
   \f[H = \frac{8\varepsilon}{g^2\sqrt{l(l+1)}}\sum_n\left[\sigma^+_n iL_{+,n}\sigma_{n+1}^- + \sigma^-_n (-iL_{-,n})\sigma_{n+1}^+\right] + \frac{4M}{g^2}\sum_n(-1)^n\left[ \sigma^z_{n+1}+1\right] + \sum_n L_{z,n}^2  \f]
   Since the ground state search could bring us out of the sector of the states which fulfill Gauss' law, we add an additional penalty:
   \f[ \lambda \sum_n\left( L_{z,n} - L_{z,n-1} -\frac{1}{2}\left(\sigma^z_n +(-1)^n\right)^2\right)\f]
